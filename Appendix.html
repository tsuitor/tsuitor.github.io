<h3>Some additional musings from a 35-year career</h3>

<div class="para"><p>After reading “Code Girls”, parts of it really hit home. While we were involved in the Cold War, not World War II, some things seemed eerily similar.  I was not a cryppie, as the lingo of the time called folks, but I did provide IT support and quickly learned many of their techniques, some of which I recognized from the book. Maybe a bit more of a surprise was that while women didn’t make up as a large portion of the workforce as in WWII, they were still the majority in our largest organization when I started. However compared to what people would expect; there wasn't any major contractor support, except for cleaning and food service when I started. </p></div>

<div class="para"><p>During this time, I had a chance to learn a lot, but I was like others, intimidated by parts of the culture, and was happy to stay on the sidelines. However, by the end of the Cold War, I felt like I was a full member, even if I wasn't fully sure of what. </p></div>

<div class="para"><p>The end of the Gulf War and Cold War caused many changes. Chief of them was the formation of Z Group, which consolidated all the cryypie elements. However, I drifted more into IT support, which I basically stayed in from 1992 through 2008, by which I needed a new office badly. </p></div>
	
<div class="para"><p> In retrospect, the addition of contractors was one of the biggest changes even if our organization had the least in the agency, we still had many. While actually being a Professional Services Contractor wasn't as sexy as many believe; your additional pay was often little more than your pension; and the job was often used more as a launch pad for people transiting to or from a regular government job, whose early retirement age was hard to ignore for many.</p></div> 

<div class="para"><p>My job during this time was rather interesting. Our small team initally only had one full-time system admin, with two of us doing it part time, including me. I would have been happy to stay as a developer, but my management kept adding more IT items to my menu and I seemed to enjoy it. In time as my development projects finished, I became more of a system administrator. I continued this dual role at least until the mid-90s. During the early part of this period, my management sent me and another person part-time to a group that was going to standardize graphical interfaces in the agency. We quickly named ourselves the “GUI Police” and that turned into probably the most work I would do. The only advantage for me was upper management wanted to keep the guide unclassified, so I was able to show my family some of what I actually did. After a short rest stop in my original office, I ended up on a high-visibility diversity tour working on new technology just as the World Wide Web exploded. It felt like I had two full-time jobs at times. </p></div> 

<div class="para"><p>This was a real changing point for my career since I really thought I wanted to go back to programming; but I had many options, including a chance to move into management. Even after 9 months, it wasn't clear what my best option was, but I definitely felt intimidated by people in my tour's office. I kind of muddled through, and didn’t take my chances seriously enough; surprising my old office by attempting to go back to that organization. Alas, there had been a reorg and I was moved into a newly formed system admin branch. Initially after I asked they moved me into my old programming branch, but I found many changes, and after updating my initial code for thefirst times in years, I was looking for something different, as the new big project in the organization, seemed to be a dead end in reality. I didn't realize that at the time, but I had moved into a higher level of understanding systems. In a stroke of luck, I ended up being a late replacement for an in-house class for our new computer workstations one Friday morning. It turned into a fun day and changed my focus back into systems. Getting back to doing system administration, full-time, took a while, but I ended moving to a replacement organization to manage our corporate services. My new management turned out to be great in facilitating this change</p></div>

<div class="para"><p>I had found an organization that I really fit into. There was a steady stream of work to keep the current systems updated, as they had been allowed to become outdated; along with new machines to work on. While setting up our web infrastructure was supposed to be my main charge; I was stuck waiting for that technology to mature. My main project eventually turned into developing the infrastructure needed for our our first 64-bit workstations. There was a small group of us that had a chance to get rid of years of desktop cruft while updating our overall environment. We sort of realized this was going to be a once in lifetime opportunity, so we threw ourselves into it with a lot of gusto. Though eventually most of us were redirected to the Y2K project despite this project not being totally finished. By then, I had taken over the installation of some of our commercial software as well as the largest portion of our open-source portfolio though getting that through the approval process involved a lot of hand waving and sweat. Given how busy we were, I remember having to actually finish installing patches on some of our minor servers after the freeze started; which required additional paperwork on top of the actual work. We finałly finished just before Christmas and I was able to go home and have a well-deserved Christmas celebration with my family. Though I actually got a severe cold during my travels and spent the big day in bed. Luckily we actually didn’t have any major problems (I remember writing code to just fix three programs) and we were able to move on to new work soon enough.

<div class="para"><p>We had multiple retirements in our management chain during that winter and my informal agreement with Z Group management on steps I should do next on the web went up in smoke. Instead of a multi-step plan, new management wanted to just do everything in one step. Not not surprising this turned into a hurry up and wait exercise. Even my new local management focused just on keeping the keeping the current systems running, which caused additional clashes. It took a while longer for the new agency director to get the standard changes going again among our risk-averse population. In time, I was finally moved to the team that was tasked to doing development in the larger organization. It was more of a struggle to get things restarted as my main comrade in this effort, finally had enough and moved to North Carolina. Despite having way too many disruptions, I was able to keep up doing some useful work. We moved to a new building with great parking which provided some relief from all the usual nightmares. I moved to a later work schedule which helped delay my burnout, if nothing else until 2008. Though in typical government fashion, our main lab was moved into a different building than we were in. However, we took up little space in a building that was open 7x24, which was useful.</p></div> 

<div class="para"><p>As part of the larger changes going on in the world, by 2001, there was pressure to consolidate much of IT into a separate vendor to update the infrastructure. While I was not directly affected, still working in an offspring of the Z Group, it was going to change my work. Our management made available a small stipend for those who stayed after the chaos of thepast few months. Given everything going on, I planned a quiet week hanging out with my family in Las Vegas. I heard the official RiF(reduction-in-force—laying off people) announcement just before I left for Las Vegas. Absorbing the changes, especially of people leaving, affected the enjoyment of my vacation. Of course a few days after I got to Las Vegas and started to somewhat de-stress, 9/11 happened. Being stuck in the early Internet Age, just trying to get back to Maryland became my biggest task. While I was scheduled to fly back on Thursday, I finally got out on a red-eye flight on Sunday. In was of those twists of faith, I was stopped in Houston, when I was finally able to call into my organization at work. After that, my nickname became, for a while, Houston, as in 'Houston, We Have a problem”, for any 6 Million Dollar fan. Meanwhile, I went back to work to a bunch of mid-shifts as we moved to a 7-24 hour office schedule, for what seemed the longest time.</p></div> 

<div class="para"><p>While the RiF was quickly canceled, work continued on creating our new vendor organization, called Eagle Allince, though better known as Evil Appliance. The problems with this setup were well known on the ground; it took way longer for many of them to get to senior management. Many fixes occurred, but as usual by now; the changes that would occur as our organization expanded, which seemed to be a shock to some; did not get proper planning. Many were happier to be the large fish in a smaller pond than being a slightly smaller fish in a bigger pond.</p></div>

<div class="para"><p>In retrospect, I skipped over my last good diversity tour in 2006 as I felt like I had too much going on in my life and didn'thave anyone give me a needed shove off my hampster wheel.  I did have a good diversity tour available, but in retrospect, I was addicted to the hamster wheel of my regular job. I stayed involved in daily technical work longer than I should and fizzled out in the end. Seemingly as usual, I was on a West Coast swing visiting friends and family as the Edward Snowden leaks occurred in 2013. Unlike earlier times; I was little involved in this clean-up. Though some of the changes made my transition to retirement easier as some real stupidity was killed off; I was never able to recover my energy, however.</p></div>
