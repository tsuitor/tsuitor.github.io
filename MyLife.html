<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>Sometime soon after I was rushed to the hospital and explained all my defects to a nurse my first night, she asked if was I like other handicapped people she had met, where they had lived their lives by getting everything out of their body while they could and were ready for what was next. I hadn't thought about it in such terms, but I had to agree. During the next week, I had multiple other doctors and nurses ask similar questions; I suspect that belief isn't that unusual among folks similar to me. It's kind of hard to explain that I've spent nearly all my life thinking that my body isn't the same thing as myself; I suspect it was one way I kept my sanity. I also had my version of yin-and-yang. Even if something was going well in one area, it often felt like another area would be off just enough to remind me that I was unique/special.</p>

<p>After spending three weeks in the hospital with a cancer diagnosis, I was happy to be going to a rehab center where I would hopefully recover more strength from my surgeries, hopefully start walking again, and with some luck my lovely wife Elza could rejoin me. While the place was fine enough, none of the rest happened. I was feeling somewhat better and went through daily rehab, but I could only walk a step or two before feeling lightheaded; plus my request for an emergency Visa for Elza got stuck in some spam folder for weeks before I realized something was out of order. </p>

<p>After that month I was transferred to a small adult care facility on what was Super Bowl Sunday. After a few days of getting everything organized, the nurses who ran that place, sisters from Ghana, did a wonderful job of nursing me back to health. I started regaining strength and being able to do even simple things, like watching TV for more than 30 minutes again. Eventually, they had a specialized wound nurse, who worked on getting the right dressing for my wounds and finally healing them up. I also started the process of getting treatment for my cancer. Initially, I had been referred to Howard U Medical Center, but we changed that to a Medstar hospital much closer to where I was then, but that delayed things for another month. Luckily my lovely wife Elza, finally made it, but my condition shocked her more than I expected. We decided it was better to find someplace closer to live where my treatment was. A good friend from work drove her around and they found a lovely place in Gaithersburg. While smaller than my place and more expensive, it was much more up-to-date and they had an extra storage room for my books. While she was getting our new living space together while getting rid of 30 years of debris; I was starting a new round of tests before treatment. The CAT scan showed spots on my lungs, indicating my cancer had spread since my earlier scans. My doctor declared it at stage 4. And while they may have been able to treat it earlier, I was so weak, that it probably would have killed me. After that, given that I was stable, I signed up for hospice care and at the beginning of August I was finally able to move in with my lovely wife, Elza. It took a bit longer to get everything set up, but in September my brother and sister-in-law were finally able to visit. Where they discovered that while Maryland wasn't horrible, its traffic was. </p>

<h3>The Early Years</h3>

<p>As a sign of my life, my first memory was when I was around three years old in a hospital after some surgery on my right eye. I survived that and mostly had a wonderful childhood, though it probably took me until fifth grade to wrap my mind around my disabilities.</p>

<p>My adolescent years were a challenge, not just the usual hormonal changes, but the fact I had two surgeries on both of my legs for two of the summers. Spending weeks in a wheelchair wasn't a fun experience and learning to walk again was its own challenge. Luckily my parents had sold their grocery stores and were able to use some downtime while taking care of me. Neighbors, family, and friends helped greatly in my recovery as well. Given the limited entertainment options available, it probably helped that Watergate dominated the news cycles for one of those surgeries. For me, a few months after recovery from the second surgery I started feeding like a normal person and no longer had to wear braces on my legs. As an aside, sometime after I got my first Tivo, it was set to do the recommended recording. One it had I found during a snow day was called something like &quot; shark attack surgery&quot; which I started watching on a whim. It turned out to be about operations similar to what I had. It was profound to see kids who were dealing with the same things I did. During this time, my family had a chance to catch the travel bug and drive throughout much of the Western US. I don't think we were ever cured of the bug and in one way that became a major part of my life. </p>

<p>My high school years were in ways easier. After trying real estate for a few years, my parents wanted to get back into retail and got the franchise for the local, state-controlled liquor store. That gave us a stable income, though the hours were longer; and I had a unique summer job through college. I enjoyed being able to blend in with 800 students in my sophomore year of high school. New high schools in the county, cut the total to 350 for my junior and senior years, but that seemed large enough by then. For me, discovering the data processing class changed my life. After one semester of an organized class, I and a couple of guys were able to take self-study classes. These mostly were early attempts at writing code in BASIC on one of the terminal/teletype machines scattered in the high school. It quickly became another part of my life that drove out other interests. It was a wonderful experience given the technology, but by the time I graduated, I knew I missed out on some of the high school experiences. </p>

<p>Going to college was a stressful event, being 160 miles from home was a new experience. I adjusted pretty well. I met some good friends while living in an all-male dorm. I also quickly got used to the Computer Science Department and our CDC Cyber mainframe computer of that era. While I wasn't a social butterfly, I at least had something of a social life, actually being seen in the company of females. I felt almost normal by the time I graduated with my degree in four years, though I had to take more than a full load my last year, which was a mistake in retrospect. I don't get any job offers during that recessionary year, alas. </p>

<p>I had always wanted to get my Master and while I don't think my parents understood, they allowed me a year working at the store while applying for graduate school. </p>

<p>I went back in 1984 and probably had a real social life for the first time. I lived in the international dorm and had a unique experience that I will always cherish. Alas, I got stuck in a nightmare where my initial GPA was too low to get into Grad School, but after raising it, the Computer Science Department wouldn't take me. After looking around a bit, another degree in Math Science turned into the winning formula.</p>

<h3>Starting Work</h3>

<p>During that Spring, I had an interview with an organization of the Department of Defense out in Maryland. It was the first of what turned into a routine cross-country trip. I was hired as an intern; it sounded interesting; to work in three different offices, take a few classes, and learn about the agency before I moved into my permanent office in the fourth year. I and my dad had an epic cross-country trip to get me setup in August. It turns out fall is the best season to be in Maryland. Alas, I was an indifferent intern; I quickly learned the program was set up more for computer operators to move into other fields than anything else. They didn't have much for people who already had their degrees; that part was a new addition. I remember spending most of my first year trying to get out of taking an additional 400-level computer science class, than anything else in the program.</p>

<p>My first office was a small fun group, with a couple of people with roots west of the Rockies, though I quickly learned I was a free laborer and didn't get assigned the best projects. My second office was even more fun; it was located in some repurposed flood control trailers that had long seen their best days. We mostly didn’t have indoor plumbing, reliable heat in the winter, or a/c in the summer and poor phone service; but we had our own BBQ pit which was a nice benefit, though the lawn tennis court was gone by the time I got there. It allowed me to ignore almost everything else and write an insane amount of C code. Having some Unix experience I was able to play sys admin on my workstation. After that, my third tour was a more traditional organization in a regular building, but at least with a bunch of new hires; the primary mission was converting old code to C to run on modem Unix systems. I quickly found myself busy on that, while also finishing my Intern requirements. I found that the people who administered the intern program didn't understand anything about the classes in the requirements; I wasted several weeks basically redoing a class, that everyone took when we started, with a different name. Even writing a technical paper, which I saw as a straightforward assignment, ended up taking longer, since my reader expected to inject herself into the writing process and wasn't happy that I turned in a paper that I considered mostly done. After throwing myself at the head of the advisory panel, I was allowed to graduate late, which was only notable for me since it was the last time my parents got to see me graduate from anything. By the time I graduated, they started reforming that program, giving degree holders the chance to get a master's degree among many other improvements, but I didn't enjoy my experience. </p>

<p>While I was trying to finish the program, I also started my first real office. It was a newly formed office related to one of the intern tours, with other new hires. I was hired to write a then-new X11 Window System GUI while riding herd over a menagerie of workstations. It turned out to be a nightmare. We were stuck in half desks in another office while our new spaces were rehabbed. Our primary workstations were in another machine room on another floor that we didn't have direct access to. The code I was supposed to write a GUI for, turned out to be so broken that I spent weeks just fixing it. Then my management asked me to look at fixing another system that was partially broken. After spending weeks trying to get my head around it, with the usual government meetings, etc.; we found out nobody was using the data from that system. Meanwhile, I was also spending time in my last intern office trying to wrap up my intern stuff. Given, that they had just moved to their own rehabbed space, the management there was pretty mellow in letting me hang out there. By the time, my first real office had moved into their own spaces, I was pretty bummed out of that organization. In retrospect, I was way too inexperienced for what they wanted to do. When my last intern office had an opening a few months later, they offered me a chance to come back and I took it. I did feel bad for my first office and ended up doing a little bit of sys administration for them until they could get a replacement. </p>

<h3>My Actual Career</h3>

<p>While I started working in the second half of 1986, but was probably closer to 1992 that I feel like I started my career. While my intern contract required me to spend six years at our agency and I really wanted to get involved with an organization and projects to see what i could do. All things considered, I think I had a pretty good run for the next twenty years. </p>

<p>It seemed I would move into a fun office with good management that would slowly devolve and after seven years I would move to something new and fresh. It was only in the last decade, when my body started to break down and my usual drive left me that I really struggled. I was at the height of my powers by 2007 and enjoying current office despite the fact our lab wasn’t even in the same building as our office. However, I was starting to get overwhelmed with work, and after starting a new project without having enough time to make sufficient progress, I was frustrated and with a reorganization in our future, I started to look at new offices. I emailed a former manager and asked if there was anything in her neck of the woods. She said yes and after a quick interview, we came to a mutual agreement for my new position, or so I thought. I figured moving to a new office would help me regain my energy. </p>

<p>I will always remember that new office. The fact it took several months to actually move to the office because of the reorganization, should have been a warning sign. A few weeks after I arrived, I went in to talk to one of my managers after solving a minor problem. I found her talking to one of her IT managers. We did the usual new employee chit-chat and I didn't think anything of it; that manager seemed nice enough. Later that day, I overheard my local management complaining that I shouldn't be talking to their management! In hindsight, since I clearly wasn’t doing clerical work, they didn't want me talking with their manager, since their goal was to run a clerical shop. Needless to say, very little of the office made any sense when I got there. I expected some differences since my interview, but it seemed like a totally different place. Where my managers knew my interests six months earlier, now they seemed to know little beyond my name. Instead of the technical work, I was expecting, or even staff work, my options mostly involved clerical procurement work, but then they never actually gave me such work. One time their management even told them to assign some work to me, but even that wasn’t enough to get them to move. I did have one technical project, managing some open-source software that I enjoyed, but since my management seemed focused on clerical work, they had little interest. Meanwhile planning was also totally out, so I didn’t have that option. I sort of survived, but I'm sure I got PTSD from the entire experience. Near the end, after I saw a report produced for the CIO about open-source software, I was able to contact the CIO, and with the next reorganization, my project was moved to a new organization for a better fit, while the original organization apparently got a new mission. My only enjoyable time in the organization was after my management met with the CIO and they apparently had to at least find IT-related jobs for everyone in the organization before their new management took over; it was funny to see all the people who had been outsourced to the bookkeeping mission start working for the IT mission again. </p>

<p>I moved into the new office, but they lacked enough resources to do the open-source mission that needed to be done and I continued to struggle. I wanted to move out of a purely technical role, but we lacked the resources. My management tried to help, probably recognizing that I was burned out before I did. Since I was close enough to regular retirement, they tried to keep me somewhat busy while moving me to a new project. My last two years were spent in a lower-key role as I was moved to a part-time billet. Sadly I was unable to recover as much as I wanted. </p>

<h3>My Pillars </h3>

<p>In retrospect, throughout my career, I had a few items that I was able to focus on. </p>

<p>While I started as a computer programmer; I ended up moving to systems soon after, but I kept an eye on the programming side nearly all my career. However, I spent most of my time managing systems. Some of the time it was for others; other times it was while I developing tools and I ended up managing the system for myself. At least for me, the title of computer systems architect was the one I was most proud of, that defined my favorite role. </p>

<p>Among technical issues, three would be pillars of my career. The first would be the rise of open-source software, which I was lucky enough to spend nearly my entire career with. It's funny to think what discovering the Free Software Foundation and Gnu software in 1990 would lead to. Similarly, I spent nearly all my career on Unix and Unix-like systems. Even in the early 2000s when Windows seemed the future, I was able to work primarily with Linux. Though my last few years were on Windows desktops, it became clear Linux would be everywhere else. Finally, I spent nearly all my career with what initially would be called collaborative software. I would start with the Notes software from PLATO, but the World Wide Web would take much of my time. I was lucky enough to discover both Gopher and the WWW during one weekend in 1993 and my life was never the same. I enjoyed working on that for the longest time. </p>

<p>The amount of change computers and IT went through my career was immense if you think about it. And I was lucky enough to be along for the ride.</p>
	
<h3>My Travels</h3>

<p>Many times since 1986 being able to get away for even a few days cleared my mind. The first time I left the East Coast was soon after I started. I took advantage of a three-day weekend, homecoming at Oregon State, and very good friends in college to make a quick trip, see some college football in the early afternoon as God intended, and enjoy a wine tasting later that night. Sunday I was able to talk with my parents and surprise them with my location. They made it up Monday and I'm sure my mom was happy to see me after a couple of months. Flew out Tuesday; had friends pick me up at BWI later and made it back to work Wednesday, but dragged that week.</p>

<p>After my initial last-minute trip, I continued to travel back to the West Coast almost as much as I could. Mostly to visit family. Later as I started going to technical conferences, most of which were held on the West Coast, I usually tried to squeeze in a short trip to visit friends and family. During the busy year of 1999, I made four trips, two back to Grants Pass and my first foreign trip, as well to Ottawa. Which may have been my limit.</p>

<p>I was always interested in taking a cruise after watching The Love Boat in my younger days. During the summer of 2000, I heard about the company GeekCruises which offered technical seminars on cruises. Turing 40 in 2001, I decided to try one out in early 2001. For me that was perfect, an XML seminar during sea days, while having a regular cruise experience other times. I was hooked pretty quickly and after a few years started going on cruises on my own. One of my favorite trips was taking my mom on a cruise around a year after my dad passed away. I think she was looking to get out again and she had a wonderful time. She enjoyed people-watching on the Lido Deck; but also enjoyed dressing up, or maybe having me dress up, for what was then regular formal dinners. It was one of those times, I knew I had done good.</p>

<p>I even started going to some of the nicer hotels in South Florida for short vacations after my mom passed; it turned out I enjoyed taking a few days off, where I could enjoy lying about the pool in the afternoon and having a good dinner in the evening. When I turned 50, I even had a fun trip of meeting a friend in Miami and we then flew to Aruba for a week. A few years later, I met a lovely Filipina on a cruise and then took a couple of trips to Asia to meet up with her. I was lucky enough to see Bali, Boracay, Manila, and Singapore. That place also had me flying non-stop from Singapore to London on an Airbus A380 as part of an around-the-earth trip, which made my inner airplane geek happy.</p>

<p>However, my body was getting weaker and I had to be more careful on my trips among other things. I was eligible to retire near the end of 2017, so I did. I spent that Christmas with my brother and sister-in-law in Las Vegas for the first time in several years. After that, I was mostly planning on taking a gap year while I figured out what to do next. I had a lovely retirement cruise from Long Beach to Ft Lauderdale through the Panama Canal. I also did various other cruises that year, a summer cruise with a friend to Alaska being memorable. I also started to make a dent on my pile of unread books. The best cruise was on Carnival Vista at the end of 2018 where I met this wonderful woman, Elza. We stayed in contact regularly and my plans changed. We met again in 2019 and got engaged. After reviewing our options, we decided to get married in early 2020 in St Lucia. Alas, the pandemic put an end to most of our plans and it wasn't until 2023 after all the paperwork was approved by the government, that we were able to reunite.</p>

<p>In true fashion of my life, I suspect my last flight was a night flight from Miami back to Baltimore that was delayed because they had a leaky seal on the pilot's window; we didn’t get back in Baltimore until 2 AM; on a day we started at Trinidad at 4 AM. </p>
