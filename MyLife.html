<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>Sometime soon after I was rushed to the hospital and explained all my defects to a nurse my first night, she asked if was I like other handicapped people she had met, where they had lived their lives by getting everything out of their body while they could and were ready for what was next. I hadn't thought about it in such terms, but I had to agree. During the next week, I had multiple other doctors and nurses ask similar questions; I suspect that belief isn't that unusual among folks similar to me. It's kind of hard to explain; I've spent nearly all my life thinking that my body isn't the same thing as myself; I suspect it was one way I kept my sanity at times. I also had my version of yin-and-yang. Even if something was going well in one area, it often felt like another area would be off just enough to remind me that I was unique and special.</p>

<p>After spending three weeks in the hospital with six surgeries and a cancer diagnosis, I was happy to be going to a rehab center where I would hopefully recover more strength; hopefully start walking again, and with some luck my lovely wife Elza could rejoin me. While the place was nice enough, none of the rest happened. I was feeling somewhat better and went through daily rehab, but I could only walk a step or two before feeling lightheaded; plus my request for an emergency Visa for Elza got stuck in some spam folder for days before I realized something was out of order. </p>

<p>After that month I was transferred to a small adult care facility on what was Super Bowl Sunday. After a few days of getting everything organized, the nurses, sisters actually, who ran that place, did a wonderful job of nursing me back to health. I started regaining strength and being able to do even simple things, but I still wasn't able toeven sit up for extended periods. Eventually, they had a specialized wound nurse, who worked on getting the right dressing for my skin and finally healing my wounds. I also started the process of getting treatment. Initially, I had been referred to Howard U Medical Center, but we changed that to a Medstar hospital much closer to where I was then, but that delayed things for another month. Luckily my lovely wife Elza, finally made it to the US, but my condition shocked her more than I expected. We decided it was better to find her someplace closer to live where my treatment was expected to be. Additionally when she got to my apartment, we discovered my car had been towed and later sold. A good friend from work drove her around and they found a lovely place in Gaithersburg. While smaller than my place and more expensive, it was much more up-to-date and they had an extra storage for my books. While she was getting our new living space together as well getting rid of 30 years of debris from my old apartment; I was starting a new round of tests before treatment. The CAT scan showed spots on my lungs, indicating my cancer had spread since my earlier scans. My doctor declared it at stage 4. And while they may have been able to treat it earlier, I was so weak, that it probably would have killed me. After that, given that I was stable, I signed up for hospice care and at the beginning of August I was finally able to move in with my lovely wife, Elza. It took a bit longer to get everything set up, but in September my brother and sister-in-law, who was recovering from her own health issue, were finally able to visit. Where they discovered that while Maryland wasn't horrible, its traffic was. </p>

<h3>The Early Years</h3>

<p>As a sign of my life, my first memory was when I was around three years old in a hospital after some surgery on my right eye. I survived that and mostly had a wonderful childhood, though it probably took me until fifth grade to wrap my mind around my disabilities. At that time, being handicapped meant I had to wear special shoes with braces. In addition, I had lost hearing in my right ear due to early childhood cold or flu.</p>

<p>My adolescent years were a challenge, not just the usual hormonal changes, but the fact I had two surgeries on both of my legs during two of the summers. Spending weeks in a wheelchair wasn't a fun experience and learning to walk again was its own challenge. Luckily my parents had sold their grocery stores and were able to use some downtime while taking care of me. Neighbors, family, and friends helped greatly in my recovery as well. Given the limited entertainment options available, it probably helped that Watergate dominated the news cycles for one of those surgeries. For me, a few months after recovery from the second surgery I started feeding like a normal person and no longer had to wear braces on my legs. As an aside, sometime after I got my first Tivo, it was set to do the recommended recording. One snow day I found there was a Discovery documentary called something like &quot; shark attack surgery&quot; which I started watching on a whim. It turned out to be about operations similar to what I had. It was profound to see kids who were dealing with the same issies I did. During this time, my family had a chance to catch the travel bug and drive throughout much of the Western US. I don't think we were ever cured of the bug and in one way that became a major part of my life. </p>

<p>My high school years were in ways easier. After trying real estate for a few years, my parents wanted to get back into retail and got the franchise for the local, state-controlled liquor store. That gave us a stable income, though the hours were longer; and I had a unique summer job through college. I enjoyed being able to blend in with 800 students in my sophomore year of high school. New high schools in the county, cut the total closer to 350 for my junior and senior years, but that seemed large enough by then. For me, discovering the data processing class changed my life. After one semester of an organized class, I and a couple of friends were able to take self-study classes. These mostly were early attempts at writing code in BASIC on one of the terminal/teletype machines scattered in the high school. It quickly became another part of my life that drove out other interests. It was a wonderful experience given the technology, but by the time I graduated, I knew I missed out on some of the high school experiences. Probably because I had no chance of actually playing sports, I became hooked on watching sports on TV. It didn't hurt that the Portland Trailblazers won their only championship in 1977; I and my dad because fans for life.</p>

<p>Going to college at Oregon State initially was a stressful event, being 160 miles from home was a new experience. I adjusted pretty well. I met some great friends while living in an all-male dorm. While our college football games were played in the early afternoon as God intended, we had a poor team and I only went to a game a year, but I went through my college years without seeing a victory. Basketball was another matter; we had a top-ranked team my first two years, but alas we went out early in the tournament. The only game I went to, was the last game of my sophomore year, where we were undefeated and ranked number one, but we lost to a top 5 Arizona State team. My best friend suggested I should not attend any other games since I was bad luck, which I mostly did until our team didn't matter. I also quickly got used to the Computer Science Department and the CDC Cyber mainframe computer of that era. Though we started seeing IBM PCs by my senior year; while our department had moved partially to a PDP-11 running version 7 of BSD Unix for some of our senior classes. Though I also had a couple of classes that still used FORTRAN for the last time.  While I wasn't a social butterfly, I at least had something of a social life, actually being seen in the company of females. I felt almost normal by the time I graduated with my degree in four years, though I had to take more than a full load my last year, which was a mistake in retrospect. I don't get any job offers during that recessionary year, alas. </p>

<p>I had always wanted to get my Master's degree and while I don't think my parents totały understood, they allowed me a year working at the store while applying for graduate school. </p>

<p>I went back to Oregon State in 1984 and probably had a real social life for the first time. I lived in the international dorm and had a unique experience that I will always cherish. Alas, I got stuck in a nightmare where my initial GPA was too low to get into Grad School, but after raising it, the Computer Science Department wouldn't take me. After looking around a bit, another degree in Math Science turned into the winning formula. I also had a more success in getting a job offer after I graduated.</p>

<h3>Starting Work</h3>

<p>During that Spring, I had an interview with an organization of the Department of Defense out in Maryland. It was the first of what turned into a routine cross-country trip. I was hired as an intern; it sounded interesting; to work in three different offices, take a few classes, and learn about the agency before I moved into my permanent office. I and my dad had an epic cross-country trip to get me setup in August. It turns out fall is the best season to be in Maryland and my starting class had a fun time playing tourists. Alas, I was an indifferent intern; I quickly learned the program was set up more for computer operators to move into other fields than anything else. They didn't have much for people who already had their degrees; that part was a new addition. I remember spending most of my first year trying to get out of taking an additional 400-level computer science class, than anything else in the program.</p>

<p>My first office was a small fun group, with a couple of people with roots west of the Rockies; I remain in contact with one to this day; though I quickly learned I was free labor and didn't get assigned the best projects. My second office was even more fun; it was located in some repurposed flood control trailers that had long seen their best days. We mostly didn’t have indoor plumbing, reliable heat in the winter, or a/c in the summer and poor phone service; but we had our own BBQ pit which was a nice side benefit, though the lawn tennis court was gone by the time I got there. It allowed me to ignore almost everything else and write an insane amount of C code. Having some Unix experience I was able to play sys admin on my workstation. After that, my third tour was a organization in a nice regular building with heat and air conditioning, but at least with a bunch of new hires; the primary mission was converting old code to C to run on modem Unix systems. I quickly found myself busy on that, while also trying to finish my Intern requirements. I found that the people who administered the intern program didn't understand much about the classes in the requirements; I wasted several weeks basically redoing a class, that everyone took when we started, basically with a different name. Even writing a technical paper, which I saw as a straightforward assignment, ended up taking longer, since my reader expected to inject herself into the writing process and wasn't happy that I turned in a paper that I considered mostly done. After throwing myself at the head of the advisory panel, I was allowed to graduate late, which was only notable for me since it was the last time my parents got to see me graduate from anything. By the time I graduated, they started reforming that program, giving degree holders the chance to get a master's degree among many other improvements, but I didn't enjoy my experience. </p>

<p>While I was trying to finish the program, I also started my first real office. It was a newly formed office related to one of the intern tours, with other new hires. I was hired to write a then-new X11 Window System GUI while riding herd over a menagerie of workstations. It turned out to be a nightmare. We were stuck in half desks in another office while our new spaces were getting ready. Not to mention, I found out later, that one wall was full of asbestos. Our primary workstations were in another machine room on another floor that we didn't have direct access to. The code I was supposed to write a GUI for, turned out to be so broken that I spent weeks just fixing that first. Then my management asked me to look at fixing another system that was partially broken. After spending weeks trying to get my head around it, with the usual government meetings, etc.; we found out nobody was using the data from that system. Meanwhile, I was also spending time in my last intern office trying to wrap up my intern stuff. Given, that they had just moved to their own rehabbed space, the management there was pretty mellow in letting me hang out there. By the time, my first real office had moved into their own spaces, I was pretty bummed out of that organization. In retrospect, I was way too inexperienced for what they wanted me to do. When my last intern office had an opening a few months later, they offered me a chance to come back and I took it. I did feel bad for my first office and ended up doing a little bit of sys administration for them until they could get a replacement. </p>

<h3>My Actual Career</h3>

<p>While I started working in the second half of 1986, but was probably closer to 1992 before I feel like I started my career. While my intern contract required me to spend six years at our agency and I really wanted to get involved with an organization and projects to see what I could do. All things considered, I think I had a pretty good run for the next twenty years. </p>

<p>It seemed I would move into a fun office with good management that would slowly devolve and after seven years, I would move to something new and fresh. It was only in the last decade, when my body started to break down and my usual drive left me that I really struggled. I was at the height of my powers by 2007 and enjoying my current office despite the fact our lab wasn’t even in the same building as our office. However, I was starting to get overwhelmed with work, and after starting a new project without having enough time to make sufficient progress, I was really frustrated; with a reorganization in our future, I started to look at new offices. I emailed a former manager and asked if there was anything in her neck of the woods. She said yes and after a quick interview, we came to a mutual agreement for my new position, or so I thought. I hoped moving to a new office would help me regain my energy. </p>

<p>I will always remember that new office. The fact it took several months to actually move to the office because of the reorganization, should have been a warning sign. A few weeks after I arrived, I went to talk to one of my managers after solving a minor problem. I found her talking to one of her IT managers. We did the usual new employee chit-chat and I didn't think anything of it; that manager seemed nice enough. Later that day, I overheard my local management complaining that I shouldn't be talking to their management! I never found out why, but that was just one of many strange moments I had in the organization. I expected some differences since my interview, but it seemed like a totally different place. Where my managers, knew my interests six months earlier, as we had worked together before, now they seemed to know little beyond my name. Usually, when experienced employees move into an office without similar work to what they interviewed about, management will give out a fancy title or make them a manager and try to keep the employee interested with other work, but my management couldn’t seem to be bothered, they couldn't even admit that I didn't interview to do clerical work. Instead of the technical work, I was expecting, or even staff work, my options mostly involved clerical procurement work, but even then my management never actually gave me such work. One time their management even told them to assign some work to me, but even that wasn’t enough to get them to move. They did move me physically to another organization after that, for a few months, but it turned out the local management there didn't know why I was there and didn't bother to assign me to any projects.  I did have one technical project, managing some open-source software that I enjoyed, but since my management seemed focused on the clerical work; they had little interest and I was on my own for getting any additional resources. They mostly assigned staff work to the most junior employees for some reason, so I didn’t even have that option. I sort of survived, but my health worsened and I'm sure I got PTSD from the entire experience. Near the end, after I saw a report produced for the CIO about open-source software, I was able to contact the CIO, and with the next reorganization, my project was moved to a new organization for a better fit, while the original organization apparently got a new mission. My only enjoyable time in that organization was after my management met with the CIO and they apparently had to at least find IT-related jobs for everyone in the organization before their new management took over; it was funny to see all the people who had basically been outsourced to the bookkeeping side of the mission start working for the IT mission again. I never found any rationale for what the managers of this organization did. </p>

<p>I moved into the new office, but they lacked enough resources to do the open-source mission that needed to be done and I continued to struggle. I really wanted to move out of a purely technical role by now, but we lacked the resources. Eventually my management tried to help, probably recognizing that I was burned out before I did. Since I was close enough to regular retirement, they tried to keep me busy while moving me to a new project. My last two years were spent in a lower-key role as I was moved to a part-time billet. Sadly I was unable to recover as much as I wanted. </p>

<h3>My Pillars </h3>

<p>In retrospect, throughout my career, I had a few items that I was able to focus on. </p>

<p>While I started as a computer programmer; I ended up moving to systems soon after, but I kept an eye on the programming side nearly all my career. However, I spent most of my time managing systems. Some of the time it was for others; other times it was while I developing tools and I ended up managing the system for myself. At least for me, the title of computer systems architect was the one that defined my favorite role. </p>

<p>Among technical items, three would be pillars of my career. The first would be the rise of open-source software, which I was lucky enough to spend nearly my entire career with. It's funny to think what discovering the Free Software Foundation and Gnu software in 1990 would lead to. Similarly, I spent nearly all my career on Unix and Unix-like systems. Even in the early 2000s when Windows seemed the future, I was able to work primarily with Linux. Though my last few years were on Windows desktops, it became clear Linux would be everywhere else. Finally, I spent nearly all my career with what initially would be called collaborative software. I would start with the Notes software from PLATO, but the World Wide Web would take much of my time. I was lucky enough to discover both Gopher and the WWW during one weekend in 1993 and once again my life was never the same. I enjoyed working on that for the longest time. </p>
	
<h3>My Travels</h3>

<p>Many times since 1986 being able to get away for even a few days cleared my mind. The first time I left the East Coast was soon after I started. I took advantage of a three-day weekend, homecoming at Oregon State, and very good friends in college to make a quick trip, see some college football in the afternoon, and enjoy a wine tasting later that night. Sunday I was able to talk with my parents and surprise them with my location. They made it up Monday and I'm sure my mom was happy to see me after a couple of months. Flew out Tuesday; had friends pick me up at BWI later and made it back to work Wednesday, but dragged that week.</p>

<p>After my initial last-minute trip, I continued to travel back to the West Coast almost as much as I could. Mostly to visit family. Later as I started attending technical conferences, most of which were held on the West Coast, I usually tried to squeeze in a short trip to visit friends or family. During the busy year of 1999, I made four trips, two back to Grants Pass, seeing my father before his health really declined and my first foreign trip, as well to Ottawa. Which may have been my limit. I took 2000 off from any such travels in response.</p>

<p>I was always interested in taking a cruise after watching The Love Boat in my younger days. During the summer of 2000, I heard about the company GeekCruises, now called Insight Cruises, which offered technical seminars on cruises. Turing 40 in 2001, I decided to try one out in early 2001. For me that was perfect, an XML seminar during sea days, while having a regular cruise experience the other times. I was hooked pretty quickly and after a few years started going on cruises on my own. One of my favorite trips was taking my mom on a cruise around a year after my dad passed away. I think she was looking to get out again and she had a wonderful time. She enjoyed people-watching on the Lido Deck; but also enjoyed dressing up, or maybe having me dress up, for what was then regular formal dinners. It was one of those times, I knew I had done good.</p>

<p>I even started going to some of the nicer hotels in South Florida for short vacations after my mom passed; it turned out I enjoyed taking a few days off, where I could enjoy lying about the pool in the afternoon and having a good dinner in the evening. When I turned 50, I even had a fun trip of meeting a friend in Miami and we then flew to Aruba for a relaxing week. A few years later, I met a lovely Filipina on a cruise and then took a couple of trips to Asia to meet up with her. I was lucky enough to see Bali, Boracay, Manila, and Singapore at various times. I also flew non-stop from Singapore to London on an Airbus A380 once as part of an around-the-earth trip, which made my inner airplane geek happy. I also spent quality time in Hong Kong, Heathrow, and Narita airports beyond nearly every airport in the Western United States. </p>

<p>However, my body was getting weaker and I had to be more careful just walking around. Just the few stairs at my apartment building did a number on my knees. I retired soon after I was eligible near the end of 2017. I spent that Christmas with my brother and sister-in-law in Las Vegas for the first time in several years. After that, I mostly planned on taking a gap year to recover, while I figured out what to do next. I had a lovely retirement cruise from Long Beach to Ft Lauderdale through the Panama Canal. I also did various other cruises that year, a summer cruise with a friend to Alaska being memorable. It turned out to be a great year for the Oregon State Baseball team, which won the Men’s College World Series, which I was lucky to watch nearly every game that season. I also started to make a dent on my pile of unread books. My best cruise ever was on Carnival Vista near the end of 2018 where I met this wonderful woman, Elza. We stayed in contact regularly and my plans changed. We met again in 2019 and got engaged. After reviewing our options, we decided to get married in early 2020 in St Lucia. Alas, the pandemic put an end to most of our plans and it wasn't until 2023 after all the paperwork was approved by the government, that we were able to reunite.</p>

<p>In true fashion of my life, I suspect my last flight was a night flight from Miami back to Baltimore that was delayed because they had a leaky seal on the pilot's window; we didn’t get back in Baltimore until 2 AM; on a day we started at Trinidad at 4 AM. </p>

<h3>Closing Thoughts</h3>

<p>I can’t help to end with a few thoughts on that part of my life that I have focused on for the past forty-five years. I’ve gone from using punch cards for a COBOL class to typing this on an text editor on my iPad and with some GitHub magic; it will appear on the web as a basic webpage (luckily I still remember HTML). That is a huge amount of change, but I can’t help to think the LLM wave of AI will cause even more change than we have seen before. I’m only a bit sad that I’m not involved with the bleeding edge for the first time in a long while. OTOH, I still keep discovering books about World War 2 that I want to add to my pile. 

<p>At the end of the day, I’m not sure if I would change anything in my life.  My time couldn't have been more magical. I ended up with a mostly great career, where I had plenty of respect from my peers and managers. Along with the past year with my love; I will also have great memories with my family and friends. While I won't quote Lou Gehrig and claim I’m the luckiest man on the face of the earth; I still feel blessed and lucky enough to live a full life, surrounded by great friends and family.</p>
